# HIST3814 log

This is my log for the first part for HIST3814.
I will be starting in the "Going Further" stream as I am quite well versed in the technical aspects, but may need to go down to the "Standard" stream as my historical abilities may be lacking.

## Software Setup

**NOTE**: The system I am currently using is running Arch Linux. 
This means that I will be using the yay package manager to install packages.

### Markdown

The editor I will be using is Visual Studio Code as this is my primary editor for all my coding, markdown, and LaTeX. 
While this is already installed on my system, it can be easily installed by running the following command:
```
yay code
```

### Github

I'm quite experienced with Github and already have an account with multiple repositories already present.

### Anaconda

This can be installed by calling:
```
yay anaconda
```
While it installed correctly, I have previously had issues with Anaconda conflicting with my Python environment and may need to uninstall anaconda and manually install needed packages.

## Markdown Tutorial

I don't really have a particular favorite academic project.
As a non-history major, my experience in history specific is relatively confined to writing small essays rather than significant projects.
In my primary degree, computer science, I've developed a few interesting projects, but much of my enjoyment comes from the underlying technologies I used and had to learn rather than the project itself.
This includes multiple projects, like my final project for distrivuted operating systems class where my group implemented a distributed file system so that you could effectively use another computer's storage as if it were on your own computer and my AI class where I implemented an AI that could play the board game Settlers of Catan.

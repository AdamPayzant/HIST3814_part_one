# HIST3814 Part 1 Reflection

Coming into this course, I interpret digital history as the predominantly the digization of historical data and it's use. 
This is an extremely generic definition, as the use of digital data is extremely vast. 
In many ways, digitized data can be used to simply increase the spread and accessibility of the content.
Additionally the data can be used for greater analysis. 
Large aggregated datasets of otherwise isolated data points can give a "birdseye" view of the data and can enable a researcher to notice trends that otherwise would not be visible.
Finally, it can be used for the greater spread of knowledge, notably to those outside of the field.
While websites such as Wikipedia have numerous failings, they have more than proved that there is a large desire for accessible information, both in terms of literal access and the ability for the average person to understand.

I want to state that I wrote the first paragraph before to reading the "History Can Be Open Source: Democratic Dreams and the Rise of Digital History" document, but seeing as it outright addresses my statement on wikipedia, I feel I should start with it.
As someone moderately involved in the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) world, this article particularly stood out to me.
In both the historical world and the software world, the path of open source adoption has been a long and difficult one.
As this text points out, the development and adoption of open knowledge struggled for many years after start of the open access movement, with the first major textbook project being *The American Yawp* started in 2014.[^1]
This bears resemblance to the difficulty of open source adoption, where it wasn't until recently that large tech companies started looking at open sourcing their own products until very recently.

These readings brought a lens both to the previously overlooked history brought into study by digital history and the gaps that still pose a risk to the data we have.
In the "Clio: Rewired" article, the advantages brought to oral histories with digitzation was covered. 
Notably how digitization allowed for greater recording of the interviews, as they could be both recorded as audio in addition to the traditional transcript.[^2]
This stood out to me as much historical record is highly colored by the recorder, and the able to preserve a record of the oral element gives future historians more data to work with and reassess in the long term.
However, due to the sheer quantity of historical data in the world, not all records can be digitized and even if they could, a dataset can only grow so large before the scale is a detriment to it's accessibility. To this end, curation is required. The problem with curated data is it is once again subject to the curator's descretion as to what is relevant for the dataset. 
Amalia S. Levi addresses this issue in a series of tweets.
The most notable to me was her statement on Livingstone Online bringing up the impossibility of a neutral archive.[^3]
This stood out to me in particular, as my experience with machine learning has really only trained me to filter out off topic data, such a collection of adult images sharing the name of a butterfly appearing in a web scraped dataset of actual butterflies, but not to really consider the bias of the data.

As taking other history courses has made me very conscious of, I am not a history student and, as much as I try, my historical abilities can be comparitively lacking.
With this in mind, I hope to use my strong technical background and start applying to non-STEM fields. 
The similar but different approach to digital history compared to areas like theoretical ML are quite interesting, and I'm very excited to learn how to better interpret data outside of computational terms as well as improving my consiousness in how I look at data and consider its potential weaknesses or latent bias.
